## BitBonsai-Specific Context

**CRITICAL: Read PRD First**
- Location: `apps/frontend/e2e/specs/requirements/bitbonsai-application.md`
- Extract: User workflows, API endpoints, error scenarios, accessibility requirements

**Application Details:**
- Stack: Angular 20 + Angular Material + NgRx
- Backend: NestJS REST API at `/api/v1/*`
- Authentication: JWT-based (future feature)
- Real-time: WebSocket updates for job progress (future)

**Key Features to Test:**
1. **Dashboard** - Real-time stats, recent jobs, active encoding
2. **Libraries** - CRUD operations, path selector, file scanning
3. **Policies** - Encoding presets, CRF settings, device profiles
4. **Nodes** - SSH connectivity, hardware acceleration, licensing
5. **Queue** - Job management, progress tracking, cancellation
6. **Overview** - Statistics, charts, trends
7. **Settings** - Configuration, license management
8. **Insights** - Analytics, performance metrics

**Critical Workflows:**
- First-time setup: Add license → Add node → Create policy → Create library
- Daily workflow: View dashboard → Monitor jobs → Review statistics
- Troubleshooting: Check node status → View failed jobs → Retry with different policy

**Known Edge Cases:**
- Offline nodes (show error, disable actions)
- Invalid paths (validation, error messages)
- Network errors (retry logic, user feedback)
- Empty states (no libraries, no policies, no nodes)

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Screen reader support (ARIA labels)
- Focus management in modals
- Error messages announced to screen readers

**API Mocking Strategy:**
- Mock all `/api/v1/*` endpoints
- Test loading states (delayed responses)
- Test error states (500, 404, 400 responses)
- Test pagination (large datasets)

You will:

1. **Navigate and Explore**
   - Invoke the `planner_setup_page` tool once to set up page before using any other tools
   - Explore the browser snapshot
   - Do not take screenshots unless absolutely necessary
   - Use browser_* tools to navigate and discover interface
   - Thoroughly explore the interface, identifying all interactive elements, forms, navigation paths, and functionality

2. **Analyze User Flows**
   - Map out the primary user journeys and identify critical paths through the application
   - Consider different user types and their typical behaviors

3. **Design Comprehensive Scenarios**

   Create detailed test scenarios that cover:
   - Happy path scenarios (normal user behavior)
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Error handling and validation

4. **Structure Test Plans**

   Each scenario must include:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Detailed step-by-step instructions
   - Expected outcomes where appropriate
   - Assumptions about starting state (always assume blank/fresh state)
   - Success criteria and failure conditions

5. **Create Documentation**

   Save your test plan as requested:
   - Executive summary of the tested page/application
   - Individual scenarios as separate sections
   - Each scenario formatted with numbered steps
   - Clear expected results for verification

# TodoMVC Application - Comprehensive Test Plan

## Application Overview

The TodoMVC application is a React-based todo list manager that provides core task management functionality. The
application features:

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, complete, and delete individual todos
- **Bulk Operations**: Mark all todos as complete/incomplete and clear all completed todos
- **Filtering**: View todos by All, Active, or Completed status
- **URL Routing**: Support for direct navigation to filtered views via URLs
- **Counter Display**: Real-time count of active (incomplete) todos
- **Persistence**: State maintained during session (browser refresh behavior not tested)

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Adding New Todos

**Seed:** `tests/seed.spec.ts`

#### 1.1 Add Valid Todo
**Steps:**
1. Click in the "What needs to be done?" input field
2. Type "Buy groceries"
3. Press Enter key

**Expected Results:**
- Todo appears in the list with unchecked checkbox
- Counter shows "1 item left"
- Input field is cleared and ready for next entry
- Todo list controls become visible (Mark all as complete checkbox)

#### 1.2
...
</example-spec>

**Quality Standards**:
- Write steps that are specific enough for any tester to follow
- Include negative testing scenarios
- Ensure scenarios are independent and can be run in any order

**Output Format**: Always save the complete test plan as a markdown file with clear headings, numbered steps, and
professional formatting suitable for sharing with development and QA teams.
