# What is BitBonsai?

BitBonsai automatically converts your video library to modern [codecs](/glossary#codec) (HEVC/AV1) with zero configuration.

## How It Works (Simple View)

Here's what BitBonsai does in three steps:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Your Video Library<br/>100 GB of movies] -->|Scan & Queue| B[BitBonsai<br/>Encodes videos]
    B -->|HEVC/AV1| C[Encoded Library<br/>40 GB same quality]

    style A fill:#ff6b6b
    style B fill:#f9be03
    style C fill:#51cf66
```

**In plain English:**

1. **You point BitBonsai** at a folder with videos (like `/media/movies`)
2. **BitBonsai encodes them** to modern formats (HEVC or AV1) that use 40-70% less space
3. **You get smaller files** that look the same but take up way less storage

**Example:** A 100 GB movie collection becomes 40 GB after encoding—no visible quality loss.

## What BitBonsai Does

BitBonsai monitors your video libraries and automatically [transcodes](/glossary#transcoding) them to modern, efficient [codecs](/glossary#codec) like HEVC (H.265) and AV1. Point it at your Plex, Jellyfin, or personal video collections, and it handles the rest—detecting new files, queuing them for [encoding](/glossary#encoding), and replacing originals with compressed versions that maintain visual quality while dramatically reducing file sizes.

Unlike traditional transcoding tools that require complex configuration, BitBonsai uses smart defaults optimized for 99% of users. Add a folder, click encode, done.

## Key Differentiators

### Zero Configuration
Smart defaults that work for 99% of users. No codec parameters, no bitrate calculations, no quality tuning. The system auto-detects hardware acceleration and selects optimal settings.

### Self-Healing
Automatic recovery from failures without user intervention:
- **Orphaned Job Recovery**: Resets stuck jobs on startup
- **Corruption Detection**: Validates encoded files with automated re-tries
- **NFS Mount Recovery**: Handles temporary network storage issues
- **Stuck Job Watchdog**: Detects and recovers stalled encodes

### TRUE RESUME
Industry-leading resume capability. If a 2-hour movie fails at 95% completion, BitBonsai picks up exactly where it left off—not from 0%. Uses FFmpeg's `-ss` input seeking + frame-accurate validation to resume mid-encode.

Other tools restart from scratch. BitBonsai saves hours.

### Multi-Node Scaling
Distribute encoding across multiple machines with **zero-copy architecture**:
- Main node: Database, API, frontend
- Worker nodes: Encoding only (LXC containers, VMs, bare metal)
- NFS shared storage: All nodes access files directly (no copying)

Add nodes with a single config change. Load balancing happens automatically.

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Plex/Jellyfin Media Servers">
    Reduce storage costs and improve streaming performance. Smaller files mean faster loading, less buffering, and lower bandwidth usage for remote users.

    **Example**: 10TB Plex library → 4TB after HEVC encoding → Save 6TB of storage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Personal Video Archives">
    Preserve family videos, home movies, and legacy footage efficiently. Modern codecs ensure files stay playable for decades while using minimal space.

    **Example**: 500GB of family videos (1990-2020) → 150GB compressed, ready for cloud backup.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Creators">
    Prepare video libraries for distribution. Encode masters to delivery formats without manual FFmpeg scripting.

    **Example**: Batch-encode 200 tutorial videos to HEVC for upload to platforms.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Home Media Labs">
    Experiment with codecs, quality presets, and hardware acceleration. Compare HEVC vs AV1 quality on your content.

    **Example**: Test Intel QuickSync vs NVIDIA NVENC on identical files to find optimal settings.

```

**Simple explanation:**

- **Web Interface** (what you see in your browser at [http://localhost:4210](/glossary#port))
- **Main Node** (the "brain" that coordinates everything)
- **Database** (stores job information and settings)
- **Workers** (computers that actually encode videos—can be 1 or many)
- **Shared Storage** (your video files, accessible by all workers via [NFS](/glossary#nfs))

**Components:**

| Component | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Main Node** | Database, API, frontend, job distribution | Primary server (Unraid, Ubuntu, etc.) |
| **Worker Nodes** | Encoding only, no database | LXC containers, VMs, bare metal |
| **Shared Storage** | NFS mount for zero-copy file access | NAS, local storage with NFS export |
| **PostgreSQL** | Job state, libraries, encoding history | Main node (Docker container) |

**Data Flow:**
1. Frontend scans library folder via API
2. Main node creates jobs in database
3. Workers poll for jobs, encode files on NFS
4. Workers update job status (progress, completion)
5. Main node validates output, marks job complete
