# Glossary

Simple explanations for technical terms used in BitBonsai documentation.

---

## Video & Encoding Terms

### Encoding
Converting video files to use less storage space while maintaining quality. Like compressing a photo to make it smaller without making it look worse.

**Example:** A 100 GB movie becomes 40 GB after encoding (60% smaller).

---

### Codec
The format used to compress video. Think of it like different file formats (like .jpg vs .png for images).

**Common codecs:**
- **H.264** - Old standard, larger files
- **HEVC (H.265)** - Modern, 40-60% smaller files
- **AV1** - Newest, 50-70% smaller files

**Related:** [Codec Selection Guide](/advanced/codec-selection)

---

### Transcoding
Converting a video from one codec to another. BitBonsai transcodes your H.264 videos to HEVC or AV1 to save space.

---

### CRF (Constant Rate Factor)
A quality setting for encoding. Lower numbers = better quality but larger files.

**Typical values:**
- CRF 18-22: Very high quality (large files)
- CRF 23-28: Balanced quality (recommended)
- CRF 29-35: Lower quality (small files)

**BitBonsai default:** CRF 23 (good balance)

---

### Bitrate
How much data is used per second of video. Higher bitrate = better quality but larger files.

**Example:** 5 Mbps (megabits per second) means 5 million bits of data per second.

---

### Hardware Acceleration
Using your computer's graphics card (GPU) to encode videos **5-10x faster** than using just the CPU.

**GPU types:**
- NVIDIA (NVENC)
- Intel (QuickSync/QSV)
- AMD (VCE/VCN)

**Related:** [GPU Setup Guide](/advanced/gpu-acceleration)

---

## Docker & Installation Terms

### Docker
A tool that runs applications in isolated "containers." Think of it like a virtual box that contains BitBonsai and everything it needs to run.

**Why use Docker?**
- Easy installation (one command)
- Works the same on all computers
- Keeps BitBonsai separate from other apps

---

### Container
A packaged application that runs in Docker. Like a self-contained app that doesn't interfere with anything else on your computer.

**Example:** BitBonsai runs in a container with its own copy of all required software.

---

### Image
A template used to create a Docker container. Like a blueprint or recipe.

**Example:** `lucidfabrics/bitbonsai:latest` is the image name.

---

### Port
A "door" on your computer that allows network connections. Each app uses a different port number.

**BitBonsai ports:**
- **4210** - Web interface (where you access BitBonsai in your browser)
- **3100** - API (internal communication)

**Example:** `http://localhost:4210` means "connect to port 4210 on my computer"

---

### Port Mapping
Connecting a port on your computer to a port inside the Docker container.

**Example:** `-p 4210:4210` means:
- Left 4210 = Your computer's port
- Right 4210 = Container's port

**Why it matters:** This is how you access BitBonsai in your web browser.

---

### Volume Mount
Connecting a folder on your computer to a folder inside the Docker container. This lets BitBonsai access your video files.

**Example:** `-v /path/to/videos:/media` means:
- Left side = Folder on your computer (`/path/to/videos`)
- Right side = Folder inside container (`/media`)

**Analogy:** Like creating a shortcut from your Desktop to a folder on an external drive.

---

### Environment Variable
A configuration setting passed to the application.

**Example:** `-e TZ=America/New_York` sets the timezone.

**Common variables:**
- `TZ` - Timezone
- `NODE_ENV` - Run mode (production or development)

---

## Multi-Node Terms

### Node
A computer running BitBonsai. You can have one node (simple) or multiple nodes (faster).

**Types:**
- **Main node** - Has the database, assigns jobs to workers
- **Child node** - Worker that encodes videos assigned by main node

**Analogy:** Main node is the manager, child nodes are the workers.

---

### Main Node
The primary BitBonsai installation that owns the database and web interface. Coordinates all encoding work.

**Responsibilities:**
- Stores job database
- Distributes jobs to workers
- Hosts the web interface

---

### Child Node (Worker)
An additional computer that helps encode videos. Receives jobs from the main node, encodes them, and reports back.

**Benefits:**
- Faster encoding (more computers = more speed)
- Use spare computers for encoding
- Can have 1 main + many workers

**Related:** [Multi-Node Setup Guide](/advanced/multi-node)

---

### NFS (Network File System)
A way for multiple computers to access the same files over a network. Required for multi-node setups.

**Why needed?** All nodes need to read the same video files, so they share them via NFS.

**Example:** Your main node has videos in `/videos`, child nodes can access the same folder via NFS.

---

### Load Balancing
Automatically distributing encoding jobs across multiple nodes to use all available computing power efficiently.

**BitBonsai does this automatically** - you don't need to configure anything.

---

## Storage Terms

### Library
A folder containing video files that you want BitBonsai to encode.

**Example:** `/media/movies` or `/videos/tv-shows`

---

### Temporary Files
Files created during encoding that are deleted after the job completes. BitBonsai needs space for these.

**Storage needed:** ~2-5 GB per active encoding job.

---

### Atomic Replace
Safely replacing the original file with the encoded version. BitBonsai uses a rename operation (not copy) to prevent corruption.

**Why it matters:** If encoding fails or is interrupted, your original file is safe.

---

## Job Status Terms

### Job
A single video file being encoded. Each video in your library becomes one job.

**Job lifecycle:**
1. **QUEUED** - Waiting to start
2. **ENCODING** - Currently being processed
3. **COMPLETED** - Successfully encoded
4. **FAILED** - Error occurred (can retry)
5. **CORRUPTED** - Output file is damaged (auto-retried)

---

### Queue
The list of jobs waiting to be encoded. Jobs are processed in order (oldest first).

---

### Self-Healing
BitBonsai's ability to automatically recover from errors without manual intervention.

**Examples:**
- Retries failed jobs automatically (3 times)
- Detects corrupted output files and re-encodes
- Recovers stuck jobs on startup
- Validates health of encoded files

**Philosophy:** You shouldn't need to babysit the encoding process.

---

## System Terms

### API (Application Programming Interface)
The internal communication system BitBonsai uses. You don't interact with it directly - the web interface does.

**Port:** 3100 (internal only)

---

### Database
Where BitBonsai stores information about jobs, libraries, and settings.

**Default:** SQLite (file-based, works for most users)
**Advanced:** PostgreSQL (for high-performance setups)

---

### Health Check
BitBonsai automatically verifies encoded files can be played back correctly. If not, it marks them as CORRUPTED and retries.

**Why it matters:** Ensures you don't replace good files with broken ones.

---

## Unraid-Specific Terms

### Community Applications
Unraid's app store where you can easily install Docker containers with a few clicks.

**How to find BitBonsai:** Open Unraid web interface → Apps tab → Search "BitBonsai"

---

### Appdata
Unraid's default location for application configuration files.

**BitBonsai appdata:** `/mnt/user/appdata/bitbonsai`

---

### Cache Pool
Unraid's fast storage (usually SSD) used for temporary files. Dramatically speeds up encoding.

**Recommended:** Use cache pool for BitBonsai temp directory.
